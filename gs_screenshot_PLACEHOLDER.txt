Place your pasted screenshot image here and name it exactly `gs_screenshot.png`.

Path to save:
/Users/maxim/HTML/grand-service/assets/gs_screenshot.png

Steps:
1. Save the screenshot you pasted into this workspace as a PNG named `gs_screenshot.png`.
2. Put it into the `assets` folder above.
3. Refresh the pages in your browser (`index.html`, `booking.html`, `reviews.html`).

If you want, you can also run this command in Terminal (from the project folder) after placing the file:

  open index.html

If you'd like, upload the image file here and I can add it for you.
