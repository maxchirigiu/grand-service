Place your Grand Service logo image here. The site will now prefer the screenshot file named exactly:
`Снимок экрана 2025-11-19 в 15.01.35.png` (Cyrillic name with spaces) if present.
You can also use `gs_screenshot.png`, `gs.jpeg` or `share.jpg` as fallbacks.

Recommended sizes:
 - Square logo: 256x256 or 512x512 for best results
 - Favicon: browsers will use the image as favicon when present

How to add the file:
 - If you have the screenshot image locally, copy it into this folder with the exact name:
   /Users/maxim/HTML/grand-service/assets/Снимок экрана 2025-11-19 в 15.01.35.png
 - Alternatively save it as `gs_screenshot.png`, `gs.jpeg` or `share.jpg`.
 - If the image was provided in the chat, save it locally and place it at the path above.

After placing the file, refresh the pages:
 - index.html
 - booking.html
 - reviews.html

If you want, I can try to insert the exact image for you if you upload the logo file to the workspace (or provide a public URL).
